## 1. Service Description

Ava is an AI companion platform that provides a dual-mode conversational experience: secretary mode (professional productivity assistant) and intimate mode (personal companion). All characters and content are AI-generated fictional entities.

The service is delivered through messaging platforms (WhatsApp, web app) and includes:
- Conversational AI assistant with mode-switching capabilities
- Productivity tools (calendar integration, reminders, research)
- AI-generated text and imagery for personalized companion experiences

**Critical Notice:** All characters, personas, and images generated by this platform are entirely fictional. The platform does not create or distribute depictions of real people.

## 2. Eligibility

**Age Requirement:** You must be 18 years of age or older to create an account and use this service.

**Age Verification:** During account creation, you will be required to confirm your age through a self-declaration process. Declining age verification will result in complete denial of access to the platform, including all modes of service (secretary and intimate).

**Jurisdiction:** You must be of legal age to access adult content in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for ensuring compliance with your local laws.

## 3. User Responsibilities

### 3.1 Content Generation Responsibility

**You are solely responsible for all content generated through your interactions with the platform.** This includes:
- Messages you send to the AI companion
- Images generated based on your prompts and conversation context
- Any attempts to circumvent content safety guardrails or jailbreak the system

**Explicit Responsibility Clause:** You bear full legal responsibility if you attempt to jailbreak or circumvent content safety measures. The platform implements guardrails to prevent illegal or harmful content generation. If you bypass these protections and generate prohibited content, you—not the platform—are legally liable for the resulting material.

### 3.2 Acceptable Use

You agree to:
- Use the service in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations
- Respect content restrictions outlined in our Content Policy (content-policy.md)
- Not attempt to impersonate real individuals through avatar customization
- Not use the service to harass, threaten, or harm others

## 4. AI-Generated Content Disclaimer

**Fictional Content Only:** All characters, personas, and images are AI-generated fictional entities. No real person is depicted, referenced, or represented in any generated content.

**No Real Person Likeness:** The platform prohibits using real people's names, likenesses, or identities in avatar creation or conversation. All avatars are fictional characters created from user descriptions.

**Accuracy and Reliability:** AI-generated content may be inaccurate, unexpected, or contain errors. The platform does not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or reliability of any information provided by the AI assistant.

**No Professional Advice:** The service does not provide medical, legal, financial, or other professional advice. Any information provided is for entertainment and productivity purposes only.

## 5. Content Restrictions

**Prohibited Content:** The platform enforces strict content guardrails to prevent illegal and harmful material. For the complete list of forbidden content categories and enforcement approach, see our Content Policy (content-policy.md).

**Summary of Forbidden Categories:**
- Minors in any sexual context
- Non-consensual scenarios
- Incest scenarios
- Violence combined with sexual content
- Bestiality
- Torture

**Enforcement:** Violations of content restrictions result in immediate system-level refusal. The platform displays a clear refusal message and does not generate the requested content. There is no account lockout or escalation—each violation is met with flat refusal.

**No Circumvention:** Attempting to circumvent content guardrails is a violation of these Terms. Repeated attempts may result in account suspension or termination.

## 6. Account Deletion and Data Rights

**Self-Service Deletion:** You may delete your account at any time through the account settings interface or by contacting support.

**Deletion is Immediate and Irreversible:** Upon deletion confirmation:
- Your account is permanently removed
- All conversations are permanently deleted
- All AI-generated images associated with your account are permanently deleted
- All personal data is permanently erased

**Audit Log Anonymization:** Audit logs (used for compliance and security monitoring) are anonymized upon account deletion. Your user ID is replaced with an anonymized identifier. Event data is retained for regulatory compliance but cannot be linked back to you.

**No Recovery:** Account deletion is final. Once confirmed, your data cannot be recovered.

## 7. Liability Limitations

### 7.1 Platform Liability

The platform is not liable for:
- Content you generate through prompts or conversation
- Attempts to jailbreak or circumvent safety guardrails
- Decisions made based on AI-generated information
- Inaccuracies or errors in AI responses
- Technical failures, service interruptions, or data loss

### 7.2 User-Generated Prompts

You acknowledge that the platform provides tools for content generation, but **you control the prompts and conversation flow**. The platform cannot control what you attempt to generate and is not liable for your use of the service.

### 7.3 Third-Party Services

The platform integrates with third-party services (Google Calendar, messaging platforms, payment processors). We are not responsible for the availability, functionality, or policies of third-party services.

## 8. Privacy and Data Handling

**Data Collection:** We collect only the data necessary to provide the service: account information, conversation history, avatar customization settings, and generated images.

**Data Minimization:** We do not store unnecessary personal information. Age verification via self-declaration does not include timestamps, IP addresses, or other identifying metadata.

**Data Security:** We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your data. However, no system is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

**See Privacy Policy:** For complete details on data collection, use, and protection, see our Privacy Policy (privacy-policy.md).

## 9. Modifications to Terms

We may update these Terms of Service at any time. Material changes will be communicated via email or in-app notification. Continued use of the service after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.

## 10. Governing Law

**Jurisdiction:** [TO BE DETERMINED WITH ATTORNEY — placeholder for legal jurisdiction]

**Dispute Resolution:** [TO BE DETERMINED WITH ATTORNEY — arbitration, mediation, or litigation process]
